Roadmap for Graphics Application
================================

Implement data helper for SQL savegames
Set shader uniforms from scripts
Readd forward renderer as alternative
Implement tone mapping
Live reload for scripts
    Move file hash function into a file helper
Implement advanced fog
    http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fog/fog.htm
Improve Texture Mapping
    fallback to 1x1 diffuse map with pink color
Specular Lighting
    fallback to 1x1 specular map which is completely not glossy
Normal Mapping
    use reorientated blending:
    http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/blending-in-detail/
    fallback to 1x1 normal map that doesn't change vertex normals
Mesh Collision Shapes
    Determine whether a mesh is convex or concave
        http://liam.flookes.com/cs/geo/index.html
    Convex meshes use btConvexHull
        simplify by BtShapeHull vertex reduction utility
    Concave static meshes use btBvhTriangleMeshShape
    Concave dynamic meshes use btCompoundShape containing many btConvexHull
        generated by HACD
        afterwards maybe simplify by BtShapeHull vertex reduction utility
    Implement anti tunneling:
        http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Anti_tunneling_by_Motion_Clamping
Improve Lighting
    Desaturate colors in low light
    Draw bounding geometry for point lights to cull not affected pixels
    support point lights
Implement light scattering ("god rays")
Implement Window as entity (do this later and mainly for consistency)
    therefore support multiple windows
    each windows draws the scene from the camera entity it's bound to
    store active window id globally instead of active camera id
    should be fire resize and recreated events from all windows?
        maybe yes, and make also sure that the related window is set to active before
        so that viewport and shader uniforms are set for the right window
            are they window dependent?
Support transparency
Implement water system
    maybe using metaballs of varying size depending on the amount of water and or distance to player
Implement ragdoll characters
Implement character animation
Set up a project website
    buy the domain www.opengp.org which reads "Open Game Project"
Implement in game bug report tool
    send screenshot, hardware configuration, time and an optional user comment to the server
Editor capabilities
    insert, edit and transform objects
        inserted objects can get their id stored in a scripting variable or be anonym
    store scenes in files
        creating scripting commands as blueprint for the world would be cool
    allow to seamlessly switch between game and editor mode
    support resetting the world on switch
Dirt layer using multi texturing
    Crytek's dirt layer:
    http://freesdk.crydev.net/display/SDKDOC3/Dirt+Layer
Support transparent textures
    either read alpha channel or use a additional texture file
Grass system
    support for normals grass, fern and more
    maybe procedurally generate forms
    or use prebuilt meshes
