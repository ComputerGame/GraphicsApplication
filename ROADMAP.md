Roadmap for Graphics Application
================================

Implement data manager or helper to store entities in databases
    make use of SQLite for saves
    use treats or lamdas for conversion between structs and table rows
Refactor system managers and helpers
    split managers, helpers and types into header and source files
    split modules into sub projects which generate DLL files
    move asset functionality from Model module into a manager
    move file hash function into a filesystem helper
Set shader uniforms from within scripts
Meta module system
    loads in all available DLL files
    adds them to the world with their file name as name
    add scripting callbacks to toggle modules by their name
Readd forward renderer as alternative
Find window and rendering bug on Intel tablet
Live reload for scripts
    Move file hash function into a file helper
Implement advanced fog
    http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fog/fog.htm
Improve Texture Mapping
    fallback to 1x1 diffuse map with pink color
    added texture tinting through color vertex attributes
Specular Lighting
    fallback to 1x1 specular map which is completely not glossy
Normal Mapping
    use reorientated blending:
    http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/blending-in-detail/
    fallback to 1x1 normal map that doesn't change vertex normals
Support transparent textures
    either read alpha channel or use a additional texture file
    initially, only support full or none transparency
    compare different approaches for semi transparency in computer graphics
Improve Lighting
    Desaturate colors in low light
    Draw bounding geometry for point lights to cull not affected pixels
    support for spot lights
Implement Window as entity (do this later and mainly for consistency)
    therefore support multiple windows
    each windows draws the scene from the camera entity it's bound to
    store active window id globally instead of active camera id
    should be fire resize and recreated events from all windows?
        maybe yes, and make also sure that the related window is set to active before
        so that viewport and shader uniforms are set for the right window
            are they window dependent?
Implement Artifficial Intelligence
    add capsule primitive and attach to persons
    store bahavior queues attached to persons
    store AI and its state in a Thought property attached to persons
    load different AIs from scripts
Implement sky system
    Color skydome per vertex
    Render sun as alphablended texture projected onto the skydome
    Make sun moving by time and update light source accordingly
    Implement procedural clouds projected onto the skydome
    Advanced fog
        http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fog/fog.htm
    Day and night cycles
        change skydome color
        move sun and moon
        how to implement stars for night skyies?
Implement temporal anti aliasing
    store velocity vector in gbuffer
Implement light scattering ("god rays")
Implement in game profiling and benchmarking
Run scripts in namespaced of their module
Mesh Collision Shapes
    Determine whether a mesh is convex or concave
        http://liam.flookes.com/cs/geo/index.html
    Convex meshes use btConvexHull
        simplify by BtShapeHull vertex reduction utility
    Concave static meshes use btBvhTriangleMeshShape
    Concave dynamic meshes use btCompoundShape containing many btConvexHull
        generated by HACD
        afterwards maybe simplify by BtShapeHull vertex reduction utility
    Implement anti tunneling:
        http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Anti_tunneling_by_Motion_Clamping
Change from placeholder capsule to ragdoll characters
Implement character animations
Implement water system
    maybe using metaballs of varying size depending on the amount of water and or distance to player
Add modding support
    think about splitting modules into DLL files, main executable scans folders and loads their DLL files
    or instead just allow smaller modding through a Mod module
Set up a project website
    buy the domain www.opengp.org which reads "Open Game Project"
Implement in game bug report tool
    send screenshot, hardware configuration, time and an optional user comment to the server
Editor capabilities
    insert, edit and transform objects
        inserted objects can get their id stored in a scripting variable or be anonym
    store scenes in files
        creating scripting commands as blueprint for the world would be cool
    allow to seamlessly switch between game and editor mode
    support resetting the world on switch
Implement water system
    maybe using metaballs of varying size depending on the amount of water and or distance to player
        http://pub.ist.ac.at/group_wojtan/projects/2013_Ando_HALSoTM/index.html
Dirt layer using multi texturing
    Crytek's dirt layer:
    http://freesdk.crydev.net/display/SDKDOC3/Dirt+Layer
Vegetation system
    support for normals grass, fern and more
    maybe procedurally generate meshes and or textures
    or use prebuilt meshes
    bend vegetation by contacting forms
